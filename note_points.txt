Note regarding zbar (used to read barcodes and qr codes):
---------------------------------------------------------

1. The zbar (on top of zbar pyzbar-(supports zbar for python) was built) doesn't support python.
2. The open wheel file for zbar for mac is not built.
3. So can't download it through pip.
4. Download it through brew.
5. But python virtual environment built for the project can't trace it as it will be downloaded onto the global variables.
6. So while creating virtual environment enable it to seek for modules not present in virtual environment from global variables.
7. Create venv by:
8. user~ $ "python -m venv venv --system-site-packages".
9. look for pyvenv.cfg where include-system-site-packages=true.
